You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- Thirty days has September,  
April, June and November.  
All the rest have thirty-one,  
Saving February alone,  
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.  
And on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.

**How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?**
