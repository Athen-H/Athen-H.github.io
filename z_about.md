Hello, my name is Ethan. Welcome to my incredible website. :^)

Originally from Raleigh, I attended 2 years at Wake Tech before moving to Wilmington
to study film at UNCW.

In May 2021, I got a job at an online retailer doing graphic art processing. Other people
make the majority of the art, I get files ready for the art to be printed on all our products.
I quickly realized the value of automation in this role and, because I have trouble letting a problem
go once I put my mind to it, I ended up accidentally learning VBA.

I've been toted all around at work now to help people solve their computer problems, which is a bit of
a pain sometimes, but each problem is a little puzzle of its own that I can't help but try to solve.
A few months ago, a coworker told me "Every time you come in here, my job gets a little bit easier." which
couldn't have been a better compliment.

Anyway, by the end of the year I realized how much fun I had solving problems with code. Learning VBA turned
into learning Python turned into learning how to use Unity.

So I emailed my advisor, switched majors, and here we are. On my incredible website.
