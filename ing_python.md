## Turdle:
A Wordle clone made in Python using tkinter/ttk. Not nearly as clever as some of the others.

Just standard Wordle except you can play as much as you want and it can show you your green guesses
in one places which is sort of useful. *[Turdle on GitHub](https://github.com/Athen-H/Turdle)*

Input can be through keyboard or UI buttons. Gray letters fade on UI keyboard.

Red letters indicate either bad final guess or word not found in dictionary.
