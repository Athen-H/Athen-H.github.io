# Welcome to my incredible website :^)

### Hello. My name is Ethan. This is my website.

- This is a list on my website
- This is the second entry in a list on my website

Here's some code:
```py
def is_true(x):
	if x == True:
		return True
	else:
		return False

print(is_true(True))
```

Here's a formula?:

$$f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x} \,d\xi$$

And one here?:  
$$E=mc^2$$

One more try:

<p>
  When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
  \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
</p>

Thanks for visiting.
